# Deploying

The bot runs on a Linux host as a **rootless systemd user service**. GitHub `main`
is the source of truth; the host converges to it on every deploy. `.env` and the
agent's workspace (`WORKSPACE_ROOT`, which holds `memory/`) live only on the host
(gitignored) and are never touched by a deploy.

The host is referenced only by an SSH alias (default `homelab`) — the actual address
and user live in your local `~/.ssh/config`, never in this repo:

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host homelab
    HostName <ip-or-dns>
    User <you>
```

## Everyday deploy (from your dev machine)

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh "what changed"     # commits (if msg given), pushes, redeploys
./scripts/deploy.sh                     # deploy already-committed work
```

It pushes `main`, then SSHes in and runs `scripts/deploy-remote.sh`:
`git reset --hard origin/main` → `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` →
`systemctl --user restart my-agent`. **No sudo.** Override the target with
`DEPLOY_HOST=user@host ./scripts/deploy.sh`.

## One-time host setup

Prereqs on the host: `git`, `curl`, `fnm` (Node), the repo cloned to `~/my-agent`,
and a populated `.env`. Then, from an SSH session on the host:

```bash
cd ~/my-agent && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main
bash ~/my-agent/scripts/bootstrap-remote.sh
```

`bootstrap-remote.sh` pins Node (`.node-version`), installs the user unit
(`deploy/my-agent.service`), enables linger so it runs at boot, and starts it.
It needs **sudo once** (for `loginctl enable-linger`); nothing else does.

## Ops (on the host)

```bash
systemctl --user status my-agent
journalctl --user -u my-agent -f       # live logs
systemctl --user restart my-agent
```
